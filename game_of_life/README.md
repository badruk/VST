# Badruk - game_of_life

Small game of life implementation for python.

For making my life easier I decided to use conda and jupyter notebooks hence refer to anaconda for installation details.

The environment is created by running the following commands.

## create env
```
conda create --name GoL
```
## activate env
```
conda activate GoL 
```

## install required packages
```
conda install -c conda-forge notebook
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib
```
